# **Colors & Notes Privacy Policy**

**Last updated:** June 7, 2025

Welcome to Colors & Notes\!

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile and web application "Colors & Notes" (hereinafter "the Application"). Respecting your privacy is our priority.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users. This policy is written to be transparent about how we handle your data and complies with the requirements of the Google Play Console.

### **1\. What information do we collect?**

Our goal is to minimize data collection to what is strictly necessary for the proper functioning of the Application.

**a) Information you provide to us:**

* **Account Information:** When you register, we collect your email address, a password, and a display name. If you sign up through a third-party service like Google, we receive basic information from your profile (name, email address, unique identifier) in accordance with your privacy settings on that service.
* **User Content:** We store the content you create in the Application, which includes your journals, the notes you write in them, and the custom color palettes you design.

**b) Information we collect automatically:**

* **Usage and Analytics Data:** We use Firebase Analytics to understand how our users interact with the Application. This helps us improve features and the user experience. The data collected is anonymized and aggregated, and may include:
    * The frequency of Application use.
    * The most used features.
    * Information on crashes and performance.
    * Device type and operating system.

On the web version of the Application, we ask for your explicit consent via a cookie banner before enabling the collection of analytics data.

* **Device Identifiers:** We do not collect advertising identifiers (like IDFA or Google Advertising ID). We only use the identifiers necessary for the functioning of essential services like push notifications (if this feature is implemented).

### **2\. How do we use your information?**

The collected data is used to:

* **Provide and maintain the Application:** Ensure your account functions correctly, and back up and synchronize your notes and journals across your devices.
* **Improve the Application:** Analyze usage data to identify bugs, improve performance, and develop new features.
* **Personalize your experience:** Remember your preferences, such as language or the last active journal.
* **Communicate with you:** Send you important information regarding your account or service updates (never for marketing without your explicit consent).

### **3\. Sharing your information**

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for commercial purposes.

Your information may be shared in the following cases:

* **With service providers:** We use third-party services like Firebase (provided by Google) for authentication, database (Firestore), and hosting. These providers have access to your data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
* **For legal reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

### **4\. Children's Privacy**

Our Application is not intended for children under the age of 13\. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13\.

If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at the address provided below. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

### **5\. Your rights and choices**

You have several rights regarding your data:

* **Access and modification:** You can access and modify your profile information (display name) and the content you have created directly within the Application.
* **Data deletion:** You can delete your notes and journals at any time from within the Application. Deleting a journal will result in the deletion of all the notes it contains.
* **Account deletion:** To permanently delete your account and all associated data, please send us a request to the email address below.

### **6\. Data Security**

The security of your data is a priority. We use Firebase services, which implement administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

### **7\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "last updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
